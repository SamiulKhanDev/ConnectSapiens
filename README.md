# Connect Sapiens

Welcome to our WEBRTC-based Calling application! With our app, logged-in users can create rooms on specific subjects and invite others to join in. Once in a room, all users have the ability to share their ideas through voice communication.

The user who creates the room is considered the host and has the power to mute and unmute specific users as needed. Users can create as many rooms as they like and join as many other groups as they choose.

We hope you enjoy using our app for easy and efficient group communication!
